<h1>Security Audit - Botium Toys</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
As part of Google's cybersecurity certificate program, I had the opportunity to engage in a comprehensive internal IT audit for Botium Toys, a fictional small U.S. business specializing in toy development and sales. The company's expanding online presence, attracting customers both in the U.S. and abroad, has placed increasing demands on its information technology (IT) department to support the global market.<br>

The IT manager at Botium Toys recognized the need for an internal IT audit to address concerns regarding business continuity, compliance, and infrastructure security. The goal was to identify and mitigate potential risks, threats, or vulnerabilities to critical assets as the company continues to grow. Additionally, compliance with regulations related to online payments and conducting business in the European Union (E.U.) was a priority.<br>

To initiate the audit process, the IT manager adopted the National Institute of Standards and Technology Cybersecurity Framework (NIST CSF) to establish a structured approach. This involved defining the audit scope and goals, followed by a meticulous risk assessment. The primary objective was to gain an overview of the risks the company faced in its current security posture. <br>

As part of the audit team, my task was to review the IT manager's audit scope, goals, and risk assessment, and conduct an internal audit of the companyâ€™s assets, controls, and adherence to compliance regulations and standards so as to improve company's security posture.<br>

I was also tasked with clearly and concisely communicating my findings and recommendations to the IT manager and other stakeholders, so they could implement the necessary controls and create appropriate documentation, processes, and procedures to ensure business continuity, the safety of critical assets, and compliance.<br>

Subsequently, I conducted an internal audit to assess controls and verify compliance against relevant standards and regulations. And, in the end, I drafted a stakeholder memorandum to communicate the audit scope, goals, critical findings, summary and recommendations to all stakeholders, including the IT Manager.

<h2>Stakeholder Memorandum</h2>
Based on the audit scope and goals, controls assessment and compliance checklist, I complete each section of the stakeholder memorandum template to communicate my audit results and recommendations to stakeholders:

- [Critical findings (must be addressed immediately)]
- [Findings (should be addressed, but no immediate need)]
- [Summary/Recommendations]


Overall, this internal IT audit experience has provided me with valuable insights into real-world cybersecurity challenges faced by businesses in today's digital landscape. My involvement in implementing the NIST CSF, conducting a risk assessment, and completing a controls assessment and compliance checklist has enhanced my skills as a cybersecurity professional. I am excited to leverage this experience in future cybersecurity endeavors and contribute to building secure and resilient IT infrastructures.
