<h1>Security Audit - Botium Toys</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
As part of Google's cybersecurity certificate program, I had the opportunity to engage in a comprehensive internal IT audit for Botium Toys, a fictional small U.S. business specializing in toy development and sales. The company's expanding online presence, attracting customers both in the U.S. and abroad, has placed increasing demands on its information technology (IT) department to support the global market.<br>

The IT manager at Botium Toys recognized the need for an internal IT audit to address concerns regarding business continuity, compliance, and infrastructure security. The goal was to identify and mitigate potential risks, threats, or vulnerabilities to critical assets as the company continues to grow. Additionally, compliance with regulations related to online payments and conducting business in the European Union (E.U.) was a priority.<br>

To initiate the audit process, the IT manager adopted the National Institute of Standards and Technology Cybersecurity Framework (NIST CSF) to establish a structured approach. This involved defining the audit scope and goals, followed by a meticulous risk assessment. The primary objective was to gain an overview of the risks the company faced in its current security posture. <br>

As part of the audit team, my task was to review the IT manager's audit scope, goals, and risk assessment. Subsequently, I conducted an internal audit to assess controls and verify compliance against relevant standards and regulations.
